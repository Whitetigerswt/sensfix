A port of a mod created by [Slice](https://github.com/oscar-broman) for GTA3 and Vice City @ http://forum.sa-mp.nl/index.php?topic=26275.0

The difference is, there is no way to edit the sensitivity ingame, however, the sensitivity numbers between these two mods should be compatable. else, you're going to have to edit it in the .cfg file and restart the game.

as far as i can tell, there is not a seperate sensitivity while aiming with sniper, this address edits sensitivity with everything you do in the game

only tested on vc1.1 and gta31.1 exe's

compiled .ASI: https://u-army.com/tiger/random/3_vc_sensfix.asi
